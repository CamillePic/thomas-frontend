        The clients wanted a simple house, on one level, with a patio and a
           large communal space for living together. The closed spaces (entrance,
           patios, bathrooms, bedrooms, etc.) were staggered to create sub-spaces
           within the large communal space. These sub-spaces became the kitchen,
           dining room and living room so that each member of the family could
           pursue his or her activities while maintaining visual links with the
           others.  <br></br> <br></br>  The house is divided into two parts for day and night. A long corridor
           crosses these two parts, with a mirror at each end, giving the
           impression of an infinite hallway, an interior world.{" "}   </div>
