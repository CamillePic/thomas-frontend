The clients wanted a simple house, on one level, with a patio and a large communal space for living together. The closed spaces (entrance, patios, bathrooms, bedrooms, etc.) were staggered to create sub-spaces within the large communal space. These sub-spaces became the kitchen, dining room and living room so that each member of the family could pursue his or her activities while maintaining visual links with the others. 
<br> </br><br></br>
The house is divided into two parts for day and night. A long corridor crosses these two parts, with a mirror at each end, giving the impression of an infinite hallway, an interior world.        </div>
